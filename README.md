### Name

React Daily Question

### Description

A new and improved version of the React Daily Question project.

- Made with React and Typescript
- Redux Toolkit used for state management
- Redux Persist for local storage

Project will work in fundamentally the same way. MD document will be parsed to bring in questions, stored in localstorage (redux persist).

### Aims

1. Unique question per day (not random, used seed data so that the quesiton for x is always the same)
2. User can select new questions, either at random OR by clicking the question in a list
3. Keep track of questions user has seen/not seen

### Future Aims

1. Use database to store user information. Login and authentication.
2. Update MD questions automatically from github (currently I manually save the MD file to github and it's accessed from there)
